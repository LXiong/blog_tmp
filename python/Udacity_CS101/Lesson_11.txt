Lesson 11: Files, IO, and Exceptions

------------

web.py

pip install web.py

web.py was written by Aaron Swartz, and placed in the public domain. There are
many other web application frameworks for Python including Django and
Google App Engine (which is what Steve Huffman uses for the Web Application
Engineering class) which are probably better choices for large applications,
but web.py is a fantastic web framework for getting started with a simple web
application.

import web



------------------------

Files:

open(<filename>, <mode>)

>>> fout = open('python.py', 'w')
>>> fout.write('....')
>>> fout.close()



Exceptions:

try:
    <Block>
except <ExceptionType>[, <name>]:
    <Block>


try:
    fout = open('python.py', 'r')
    val = fout.readline()
    x = int(val)
    pint x
except IOError, e:
    print '...' + str(e)
print '...'


Raising Exceptions:
raise <Expression (must evaluate to an Exception instance)>



try:
    <Block>
except <ExceptionType>[, <name>]:
    <Block>
finally:
    <FinallyBlock>
    # this will always runs before try statement finishes


with <ContextGuard> a <name>:
    <Block>
    

>>> with open('txt.py', 'w') as fout:
...     fout.write(...)
