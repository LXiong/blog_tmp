Lesson 2: How to repeat

    Our main goal for this unit is to make the web crawler, instead of just
finding one link in the page, to find all the links on a page, so that we can
follow these links and collect more and more pages on the web.

    To do that we need two big concepts in computer science. The first is
procedures(步骤). Procedures are a way to package code so that we can reuse it
more easily. The second is control. We need a way to able to make decisions,
and to do repetion, to find all those links on a page.

    page = ...
    start_link = page.find("<a href=")
    start_quote = page.find('"', start_link);
    end_quote = page.find('"', start_quote+1);
    url = page[start_quote+1:end_quote]
    print url
    
    page = page[end_quote:]
    start_link = page.find("<a href=")
    start_quote = page.find('"', start_link);
    end_quote = page.find('"', start_quote+1);
    url = page[start_quote+1:end_quote]
    print url
    
    page = page[end_quote:]
    start_link = page.find("<a href=")
    ...
    
    
    The first thing we want to do, is what's called "procedural abstraction"
(过程抽象). The idea behind procedural abstraction, is that anything that we're
doing over and over again, we want to abstract, we want to make it a procedure,
and we want to make the things that change, inputs.

    A procedure is smething that takes inputs in, there can be more than one,
does some work on those inputs, and produces outputs as results.

    Inputs ---> Procedure ---> Outputs
    
    def get_next_target(page):
        start_link = page.find("<a href=")
        if start_link == -1:
            return None, 0
        start_quote = page.find('"', start_link);
        end_quote = page.find('"', start_quote+1);
        url = page[start_quote+1:end_quote]
        return url, end_quote
    
    def print_all_links(page):
        while True:
            url, endpos = get_next_target(page)
            if url:
                print url
                page = page[endpos:]
            else:
                break

Lesson 2.5: How to solve Problems

    Solving the Problem:
    - Don't Panic
    - Understand the Inputs
    - Understand the Outputs
    - Understand the Relationship - some examples
    - Consider systematically how a human solves the problem
    - Develop incrementally and test as we go
